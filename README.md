## Setup

### Local Setup

To run this project locally, follow these steps.

1. Clone the project locally, change into the directory of the `marketplace`.

    ```sh
    git clone http://10.40.3.152:13000/gogsadmin/nft-marketplace.git marketplace
    ```

2. Install the dependencies.

    ```sh
    yarn install
    ```

3. (**optional**, to start localnet) Start a local Hardhat node. If you configure it, you need to start it every time you run the application (see [configuration](#configuration)).

    ```sh
    npx hardhat node
    ```

4. (**optional**, to deploy contracts) With the network running, deploy the contracts to the local network in a separate terminal window. Change network depends your needs.

    ```sh
    yarn deploy # or yarn deploy:test for testnet and yarn deploy:local for localnet (started on step 3)
    ```

5. Start the app and go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser.

    ```sh
    yarn dev
    ```

### Using Docker

1. [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) on your machine.
2. Build your containers with `docker-compose build` _(you need to rebuild if you make changes to the configuration code)_
3. Run your containers with `docker-compose up -d`
4. You can check the status of your containers created with `docker-compose ps`

#### Makefile

The GNU make utility, commonly abbreviated make, is a tool for controlling the generation of executables from source files. A makefile is a special file, containing shell commands, that you create and name Makefile. While in the directory containing this makefile, you will type `make [target]` and the commands in the makefile will be executed. Type `make help` to see the list of available targets.

> **Install on Windows**
>
> An easy way to get GNU make on Windows is using chocolatey package manager.
>
> 1.  Install chocolatey from [here](https://chocolatey.org/install)
> 2.  Then run `choco install make`

**Targets**

You need to configure your environment variables on `.env` file to target the right docker compose configuration.

Below some of the most important targets:

-   `make build`: Builds the docker images
-   `make start`: Starts the docker containers
-   `make stop`: Stops the docker containers
-   `make ps`: Shows the status of the docker containers
-   `make help`: Prints the complete list of the available targets...

### Configuration

The project is based over Moralis API (but its functions is code wrapped to permit to be replaced easly based on future needs).

#### Dotenv

Copy the dotenv sample from `docs/.env.sample` and move it to the root renaming to `.env`.

#### Variables

Provide your `MASTER_API_KEY` from [Moralis](https://docs.moralis.io/docs/moralis-onboarding).

To deploy to the blockchain, test or main networks, we need to configure hardhat so we need to get the WebSocket and JSON RPC URLs from [Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/). Once you log into your account, create your project for the Network you need to configure and then copy the WebSocket and JSON RPC URLs and paste it on the `.env` file.

## Requirements

-   [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
-   [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#windows-stable) _(optional)_
-   [Metamask](https://metamask.io/) wallet extension installed as a browser extension
-   [Moralis](https://moralis.io/) Account
-   [WebXR API Emulator](https://blog.mozvr.com/webxr-emulator-extension/) _(optional)_

### Connect Metamask to Polygon

How to connect Polygon Testnet to MetaMask wallet? The easiest way to get it done is by searching "MATIC" on [Chainlist](https://chainlist.org/) and clicking "Add To Metamask" on "Matic (Polygon) Testnet Mumbai", and you are good to go.

## Workflows

## Structure

The project is a monorepo that contains the following applications:

-   **Web App** (Path: `app`) - The NextJS client application of the NFT Marketplace.
-   **Indexer** (Path: `servers/indexer`) - The NodeJS indexer for the smart contracts deployed on the blockchain.
-   **Parser** (Path: `servers/parser`) - A parse-server backend to migrate from a hosted server on Moralis to a self-hosted server.

The other important directories to keep in mind are:

-   **Smart Contracts** (Path: `contracts`)

    The contracts folder contains all the smart contracts (using [Solidity](https://docs.soliditylang.org/)) that need to be deployed on the blockchain and make our project work.

-   **Docker** (Path: `docker`)

    It contains all docker containers configuration that need to be deployed through the Docker Compose and the Makefile help.

-   **Scripts** (Path: `scripts`)

    This folder contains generic scripts but in particular here we can find the deploy script that allows us to deploy our smart contracts on the blockchain via hardhat.

-   **Application Binary Interface** (Path: `packages/abis`)

    The smart contract's ABIs are contained here. They are very similar to API so they are a human-readable representation of a codeâ€™s interface. ABI defines the methods and structures used to interact with the binary contract, just like API does but on a lower-level.
