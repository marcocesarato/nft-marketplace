# NFT MarketVerse - App

NextJS client application of the NFT Marketplace.

## Structure

The project's source code is mostly contained within the `src` path (Alias: `@app`).

### Folders

-   **Components** (Path: `src/components` | Alias: `@components`)

    Components are the building blocks of any react project. This folder consists of a collection of UI components like buttons, modals, inputs, loader, etc., that can be used across various files in the project. Errors components are contained inside `src/errors` folder.

-   **Hooks** (Path: `src/hooks` | Alias: `@hooks`)

    This folder consist in a collection of React Hooks which are still only used by components. Only hooks that can be consumed by all React components end up in the hooks/folder.

-   **Contexts** (Path: `src/contexts` | Alias: `@contexts`)

    Like hooks, the same strategy may apply for contexts which needs to be accessed globally by all your other files.

-   **Pages** (Path: `src/pages`)

    The files in the pages folder indicate the route of the react application. Each file in this folder contains its route. A page can contain its subfolder. Each page has its state and is usually used to call an async operation. It usually consists of various components grouped.

-   **Api** (Path: `src/pages/api`)

    Like pages folder, api folder indicate the route of the react application. Any file inside the folder `pages/api` is mapped to `/api/*` and will be treated as an API endpoint instead of a page. They are server-side only bundles and won't increase your client-side bundle size.

-   **Configs** (Path: `src/configs` | Alias: `@configs`)

    This folder consists of some configuration files where we store environment variables. We will use this file to set up multi-environment configurations or settings in the application (like address of the contracts deployed).

-   **Utils** (Path: `src/utils` | Alias: `@utils`)

    Utils folder consists of some repeatedly used functions that are commonly used in the project. It should contain only common js functions & objects like dropdown options, regex condition, data formatting, etc.

-   **Layouts** (Path: `src/layouts` | Alias: `@layouts`)

    As the name says, it contains layouts available to the whole project like header, footer, etc. We can store the header, footer, or sidebar code here and call it.

-   **Scripts** (Path: `scripts`)

    This folder contains generic scripts but in particular here we can find the graphql generation configurations.
