# How to Contribute

## Git Flow

Use [Git Flow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow) as workflow, so run `git flow init` after clone the repo.

## Use conventional commits to contribute
All commit message should follow the [Conventional Commits specification](https://conventionalcommits.org/) a message format standard which makes it easier to write automated tools on top of and to help split much as possible heavy commits. Why commits is important? Because the commits are one of the first way to communicate with your team.
