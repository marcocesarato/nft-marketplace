# How to Contribute

## Git Flow

Use [Git Flow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow) as workflow, so run `git flow init` after clone the repo.

## Use conventional commits to contribute

The [Conventional Commits](https://conventionalcommits.org/) specification is a lightweight convention on top of commit messages. It provides an easy set of rules for creating an explicit commit history; which makes it easier to write automated tools on top of. This convention dovetails with SemVer, by describing the features, fixes, and breaking changes made in commit messages.

All commit message should follow the [Conventional Commits](https://conventionalcommits.org/). Why commits is important? Because the commits are one of the first way to communicate with your team.
