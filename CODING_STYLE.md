# Coding Style

-   Most importantly, match the existing code style as much as possible.
-   Follow the ESlint rules for code-styling and Prettier rules for formatting
-   Use aliases instead of relative paths for imports
-   Avoid too much nesting, consider limiting yourself to a maximum of three or four nested folders within a single component.
